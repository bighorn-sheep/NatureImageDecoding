Please contact us (lembert1990@163.com) if you have trouble with the above method, so that we will help you.

## Requirements
-	tensorflow 1.4
-	sklearn
-	pandas
-	seaborn

## Use
The main function of this code is to receive the response signals of the human visual cortex to achieve the classification decoding of visual image stimulation.
-	NID_DeepLearning-fMRI.py

The purpose of the file is to decode the category information of the visual stimulus for the multi-voxel, multi-time visual cortical response signal using deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU, and CNN).

-	NID_MachineLearning-fMRI.py

The purpose of the file is to decode the category information of the visual stimulus for the multi-voxel, multi-time visual cortical response signal using machine learning models (RF, KNN, Ada, Bayes, rSVM, and lSVM).

-	NID_CNN-image.py

The purpose of the file is to classify natural images using CNN.

-	NID_utils.py

The file is a function library.
