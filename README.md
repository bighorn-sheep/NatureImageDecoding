# Nature Image Decoding

![Decoding.jpg](Decoding.jpg)

This work is being submitted.

Demo code for Wei Huang, “Long Short-Term Memory Network Based neural decoding of Complex Natural Images”
Please contact us (lembert1990@163.com) if you have trouble with the above method, so that we will help you obtaining the images.

## Requirements
-	tensorflow
-	sklearn

## Use
The main function of this code is to receive the response signals of the human visual cortex to achieve the classification decoding of visual image stimulation.
-	RNN/LSTM/GRU —— the response signals of the human visual cortex：
-	machine learning （random forest, K-nearest neighbor, AdaBoos, Nnaive Bayes, radical basis function support vector machine, linear support vector machine）—— the response signals of the human visual cortex：
-	CNN —— image：
